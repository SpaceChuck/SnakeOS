1.1:
  Added arguments for executables
  Executables are now run in a try loop. Because of that a bad executable will not crash SnakeOS anymore.
  Added executable "examples.py":
    SnakeOS examples.
  Added new executable "argstemplate.py":
    A template for executables using arguments.
  Added new file "exec/args.txt":
     Arguments are stored here.

1.0:
  First version of SnakeOS
